    "# Robustness Analysis for Deep Vertically Federated Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Within this notebook, we train an ensemble of “black box” deep neural network in a vertically federated setting construction and ask cognitively motivated questions. Question such as:\n",
    "- How does the network’s behavior / performance change as a function of an exogenous factor?\n",
    "    - Network depth\n",
    "    - Noise applied to different parts of the enesmble model\n",
    "- How can we modify the training algorithm to increase the network’s robustness?\n",
    "    - Can we take advantage of the vetically federated setting?"
